# A version of Baseimage-docker, updated with Ubuntu 16.04 fixes

See full readme at the original [baseimage-docker repository](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker).

I will be checking and merging PRs into this repo regularly.

All diffs from the original baseimage-docker can be [seen here](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/compare/master...hyperknot:master).
